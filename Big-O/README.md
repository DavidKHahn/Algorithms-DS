### BIG O ###

**What is good code?**

 - Readable, Scalable

Big-O Complexity revolves around Operations needed for Elements (Algorithmic efficiency).

Big-O allows us and concerns us with how many steps it takes in a function.

O(n) - Linear: Number of operations x Elements
O(1) - Constant Time: Same number of operations
