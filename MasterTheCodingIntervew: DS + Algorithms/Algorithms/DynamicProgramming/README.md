Dynamic Programming Notes:

- It is an optimization technique.  Do you have something you can cache?
- If you have something you can cache then you can use dynamic programming.
- Way to solve problems by breaking it down to a sub problems and solving each sub problems just once and storing their solutions just in case next time same problem appears.
- With dynamic programming, the pattern is usually the same.

- Memoization ~~~~~ Caching
    - Caching is a way to store values to use later on and way to speed up programs.
    - Memoization is simply a way to remember a solution to a solved problem so you don't have to calculate again.
