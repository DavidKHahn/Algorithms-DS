Sorting Notes:

- Companies such as Netflix, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook need custom sorted methods based on the data so that they can lower their costs and lower the operations that their computers need to do.
- Most places sort their data or preprocess it and all these companies including small ones usually sort data to make sure its meaningful.


    "The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.

    The time and space complexity of the sort cannot be guaranteed as it depends on the implementation."
