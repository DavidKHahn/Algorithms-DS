Sorting Notes:

- Companies such as Netflix, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook need custom sorted methods based on the data so that they can lower their costs and lower the operations that their computers need to do.
- Most places sort their data or preprocess it and all these companies including small ones usually sort data to make sure its meaningful.
