Array Notes:

String Question?
- Turn it into an Array ~ split()

Static Methods:
- lookup: O(1)
- push: O(1)
- insert: O(n)
- delete: O(n)

Dynamic Methods:
- lookup: O(1)
- append*: O(1)
- insert: O(n)
- delete: O(n)

Is it Sorted?
- Yes - Divide and Conquer - Binary Search O(log N)
- No. Will sorting make it faster? If still no, Linear Search.
- No. Is it a String? See if a Trie data structure helps.
