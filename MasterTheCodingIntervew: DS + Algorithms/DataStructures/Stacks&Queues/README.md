Stacks and Queues Notes:

Stacks: Think of them as plates stacked on top of each other vertically and can only touch the top plate and not the bottom (LIFO - Last In First Out).

- Most programming languages are modeled after Stack models (LIFO).

Stack Methods:
- lookup O(n)
- pop O(1)
- push O(1)
- peek O(1)

Queues: Think of them as an entrance to a roller coaster, first person gets to go then the next up until the last one (FIFO - First In First Out) which is opposite of Stacks.

- Used often in programming interviews and problems (ex. Restaurant app, Uber or Lyft, printers often use Queues for waiting in line situations).

Queues Methods:
- lookup O(n)
- enqueue O(1)
- dequeue O(1) / similar to pop except taking the first person out
- peek O(1)
